# ConsoleCraft
Swift Playground Book demonstrating "print" statements and output to a console.  A few sample problems and assessments included.

Note: This playground book was built upon Apple's provided Swift Playground Book Template.  From a technical standpoint, it demonstrates how to pass information to the LiveView and how to write assessments in a Swift Playground Book.
